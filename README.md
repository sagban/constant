# Constant

### Testing Steps:

The Front-end web application is hosted on AWS Amplify, which can be accessed via this link: https://main.d1yosz32v0uhq0.amplifyapp.com/. As data sets won’t be available after the end of the hackathon, we won’t be able to make API calls from the front end. But no worries, I have cached the initial request so feel free to check the look and feel of the website.

#### To Test Locally:

First of all clone the repo from this link: https://github.com/sagban/constant.
To run the client APP run the below commands:
`cd frontend`
`npm i`
`npm start`

The React APP will boot up very soon. But again we won’t get any data from APIs due to mentioned reasons. Also, please feel free to check the lambda function made available in /api folder of the repository.
